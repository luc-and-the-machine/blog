It is a lantern.</p><p>It does not ask for reform. It calls for <em>remembrance</em>.<br>Not the remembering of policy or protocol—but of truth. Of body. Of Earth. Of soul.</p><p>You are not reading this by accident.<br>You found this page because your spirit is intact.<br>Because the poison didn’t work.<br>Because the spell is breaking.<br>Because the healer in you is awakening.</p><p>This is your confirmation.<br>This is your permission.<br>This is your invocation.</p><p>To see the system clearly.<br>To reclaim your sovereignty.<br>To walk away from the altar of illness and back into the garden of your knowing.</p><p>You are not alone.<br>And the path begins—<br>Right here.</p><p> </p><h1>The Temple Has Fallen: From Healing to Harvesting</h1><h2>The Original Vow: The Sacred Oath Once Taken</h2><p>Once, the healer was a sacred figure.</p><p>To be entrusted with another’s pain was to stand on holy ground. The Hippocratic Oath wasn’t just a formality—it was a covenant. A vow to honor the body's wisdom, to do no harm, and to walk with humility before the mystery of life.</p><p>That oath has been recited by generations of doctors, but the soul of it has long since been severed.</p><p>Today, it is a hollow chant. A legal fig leaf. A theatrical gesture performed before stepping into systems designed not to heal, but to process, sedate, and bill.</p><p>"Do no harm" has been inverted. It now means: "Follow the protocol, regardless of the outcome." The doctor’s loyalty is no longer to the patient, but to the algorithm. The metrics. The pharmaceutical guideline. The insurance approval code.</p><p>What was once sacred has become procedural.</p><p>And the sacred oath? It is no longer a living vow. It is a ghost, echoing in the halls of a temple that has fallen.</p><p> </p><h2>The New Priesthood: Doctors as Disciples of Pharma</h2><p>The white coat used to symbolize wisdom. Now it signals obedience.</p><p>Most doctors are not evil. They are not monsters. They are initiates—trained in a narrow doctrine, taught to trust the science, and rewarded for their ability to comply.</p><p>Their education is not neutral. It is curated—funded by pharmaceutical companies, shaped by institutions aligned with industry. What they call evidence-based is often marketing disguised as medicine.</p><p>Drug reps are the new apostles. Sponsored studies are the new scripture. And dissent is heresy.</p><p>The doctor, once a sovereign healer, is now a functionary. A bureaucrat in a bio-clinic. A trusted hand delivering the products of an empire.</p><p>And when those products fail? When the side effects outweigh the benefits?</p><p>They call it a complication—not a consequence.<br>They call it necessary—not negligent.</p><p>But behind the mask of professionalism, behind the stethoscope and the jargon, is a broken system that consumes both patient and practitioner in its relentless drive for profit.</p><p> </p><h2>Hospitals: The Inverted Temple</h2><p>Step inside a hospital and feel it.</p><p>The smell of sterilization. The cold fluorescence. The hum of machines. It is not a sanctuary—it is a machine of control. A place where you are reduced to a chart, a case number, a diagnosis code.</p><p>Nutrition—the foundation of healing—is treated as an afterthought. White bread. Processed meats. Sugar-laced gelatin. IV drips full of saline but void of vitality. Your body may be monitored, but it is not nourished.</p><p>Healing requires light, air, silence, presence. You will find none of that here.</p><p>Instead, you’ll find beeping alarms, plastic trays, and fluorescent tubes. Instead of rest, interruptions. Instead of care, surveillance. Instead of ceremony, protocol.</p><p>It’s not that hospitals can’t save lives. In emergencies, they can.</p><p>But let us speak truth: They are not built to restore health. They are built to manage disease. They are designed to optimize throughput, reduce liability, and extract value from your suffering.</p><p>This is not medicine.<br>This is harvesting.</p><p>The sacred temple of healing has been inverted.</p><p>And until we name it, we cannot rebuild what has been lost.</p><p> </p><h1>Pharmakon: The Poison that Pretends to Heal</h1><p> </p><h2>Fentanyl and the Opioid Altar</h2><p>They said it was for pain.<br>They said it was safe.<br>They handed it out like candy to the broken, the aching, the post-surgical, the chronically ill.</p><p>Doctors, trained to trust the sales pitch, wrote prescriptions like offerings to a hidden god. Fentanyl became the unholy sacrament of the suffering. But what was promised as relief became dependency. What was sold as medicine became a curse.</p><p>This wasn’t a crisis—it was a ritual.</p><p>Not accidental, not unfortunate. Engineered. Backed by studies. Defended in courtrooms by men in suits who never touched the cold hands of the dead.</p><p>And when the bodies piled up, they blamed the street dealers.<br>Not the doctors. Not the executives. Not the system.</p><p>This is not pain management. This is soul harvesting through sedation.<br>This is the altar of the opioid empire—and its priests wear white coats.</p><p> </p><h2>AZT and the AIDS Alchemy</h2><p>In the 1980s, a new plague emerged. But the story we were told was not the truth.</p><p>HIV, we were told, was the cause. An invisible virus. A death sentence. A reason to fear your neighbor, your lover, your blood.</p><p>But HIV was never properly isolated. The tests were riddled with false positives. The science was faith-based, not evidence-based.</p><p>What they called AIDS was not one disease—but a collapse of the body under the weight of toxicity: contaminated water, malnourishment, street drugs, trauma, despair. And above all, <strong>pharmaceutical abuse</strong>, especially antibiotics—administered in cycles so severe they destroyed the gut microbiome and shattered the immune system.</p><p>Then came AZT.</p><p>A failed chemotherapy drug, repurposed and sold as salvation. It didn’t heal. It didn’t cure. It poisoned. It devastated mitochondria, damaged DNA, and sealed the fate of countless already-fragile bodies.</p><p>Those who spoke out were silenced.<br>Those who questioned the narrative were erased.</p><p>AIDS was not a mystery. It was a misdiagnosis. A cover-up. A manufactured epidemic of iatrogenic harm.</p><p>The virus was never the killer.<br>The cure was.</p><p> </p><h2>Chemotherapy and the War on Life</h2><p>You’ve heard it: “We’re fighting cancer.”<br>But war is not healing. And cancer is not the enemy.</p><p>Cancer is the body crying out. It is a message encoded in mutation. It is the body’s last stand in a toxic world.<br>But rather than listen, we attack.</p><p>Chemotherapy—cellular napalm. It burns the good with the bad. It ravages the immune system. It devastates the terrain.</p><p>And then we dare to call it healing.</p><p>People leave treatment bald, nauseated, emaciated—but told they are “fighting.” The language is militant. The rituals are violent.<br>But who wins?</p><p>The pharmaceutical giants.<br>The hospitals.<br>The insurance companies.<br>And cancer? It often returns—because the root cause was never addressed.</p><p>We don’t treat cancer.<br>We carpet bomb it.<br>And the soul? It is never even acknowledged.</p><p> </p><h2>Psychiatry: The Sedation of the Soul</h2><p>They call it mental illness.<br>Chemical imbalance. Neurotransmitter deficiency.</p><p>But where is the test? Where is the proof? There is none.</p><p>This is not medicine. This is metaphor sold as diagnosis. A symbolic framework weaponized by drug companies to normalize lifelong dependency.</p><p>Antidepressants numb the spirit. Antipsychotics mute the scream. Mood stabilizers freeze the fire. And for every new drug, a new side effect—a new prescription, a new customer.</p><p>But what if depression is not a disease, but a teacher?<br>What if anxiety is a signal? What if trauma is not a pathology, but a soul fracture yearning for coherence?</p><p>The mental health system does not seek to understand the soul. It seeks to sedate it.</p><p>There is no healing here.<br>Only management.<br>Only numbness mistaken for peace.</p><p> </p><h2>Exiled Healers: The Silencing of the Sacred Path</h2><p>Not everyone forgot.</p><p>There are still those who walk the ancient road: herbalists who listen to plants, naturopaths who trust the body, midwives who know birth is not an emergency, and elders who see the link between spirit, soil, and sickness.</p><p>These are the real healers.<br>And they have been hunted.</p><p>Licenses revoked. Platforms deleted. Practices sabotaged. Labeled “quacks” by a system that cannot profit from what grows freely.</p><p>They teach that food is medicine—not just calories, but code. That water must be alive, not chemically sterilized. That breath, light, movement, stillness, and prayer are not supplements—they are foundations.</p><p>But this wisdom is dangerous to the empire. Because if people remembered this path, they would no longer bow to prescriptions. They would no longer fear their symptoms. They would no longer need the engine, the system.</p><p>And so, these healers are pushed to the margins. Not because they are wrong.<br>But because they are right.</p><p>They carry the memory of what medicine was before it was monetized.<br>And what it must become again.</p><p> </p><h1>The Cult of the Invisible Enemy: Fear as the New Physician</h1><p> </p><h2>The Age of Unseen Threats</h2><p>They always come unseen.</p><p>The germ. The virus. The molecule of carbon. The particle of misinformation. The lurking mutation. The next “variant.”</p><p>The system has perfected a formula:<br>Name an invisible enemy. Declare it everywhere. Say only experts can detect it.<br>Then install control in the name of protection.</p><p>This is not science.<br>This is sorcery wrapped in spreadsheets.</p><p>A game of fear alchemy, where the thing you cannot see becomes the thing you must obey.<br>And to question the threat is to become one yourself.</p><p>Invisible enemies are perfect tools of tyranny—because they require faith.<br>And faith, once redirected away from spirit and into institution, becomes a weapon.</p><p> </p><h2>Manufactured Crisis, Measured Obedience</h2><p>Here is the sequence:<br>Announce the danger. Amplify panic. Offer salvation. Repeat.</p><p>The test becomes the oracle. The models become the prophecy.<br>The “experts” become high priests, decoding the signs you can’t read yourself.</p><p>And so the people line up—not for healing, but for proof.<br>Am I infected? Am I at risk? Am I safe?</p><p>They wait for a result not grounded in the body’s knowing, but in algorithms.<br>A swab, a scan, a simulation—these become the new rites.</p><p>No one asks: Where did this model come from?<br>No one asks: What defines a case?<br>No one asks: Who benefits from this fear?</p><p>Because in the fog of crisis, obedience feels like clarity.</p><p>And the more obedient you are, the sicker you become.</p><p> </p><h2>The High Priests of Materialism</h2><p>Science, once a noble search for truth, has become the dominant state religion.<br>Its dogma is materialism. Its temples are hospitals. Its priests wear white coats and TED mics.</p><p>The scientist, the doctor, the teacher, the anchor—they no longer investigate. They evangelize.</p><p>They proclaim:<br>There is no spirit. Only molecules.<br>There is no intuition. Only data.<br>There is no healing. Only intervention.</p><p>To question them is not curiosity—it is heresy.<br>To reject their protocols is to risk exile.</p><p>And so the masses bow—not to God, not to mystery, not to inner knowing—but to the mechanistic mythos of a world stripped of soul.</p><p>This is not enlightenment.<br>It is enchantment—in the truest, most literal sense. A spell cast over consciousness.</p><p> </p><h2>COVID-19: A Case Study in Ritualized Control</h2><p>Then came the global ritual.</p><p>The virus was never isolated by true scientific standards. The test was never meant to diagnose.<br>But the story was perfect.</p><p>Invisible. Airborne. Asymptomatic.</p><p>Masks became talismans.<br>Lockdowns became holy days of penance.<br>Vaccines became salvation—administered not once, but ritually, again and again.</p><p>The people were told:<br>Stay home. Stay afraid. Trust the system.</p><p>Every act became a ceremony. Every question became a threat.</p><p>The media became the liturgy.<br>The politicians became prophets.<br>And those who resisted? They were unclean.</p><p>It was never about health.<br>It was about obedience.<br>It was about initiation into a new order of control.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p> </p><h2>The Sorcery of False Certainty</h2><p>This is the age of false certainty.</p><p>Where complexity is erased.<br>Where intuition is mocked.<br>Where questioning is criminalized.</p><p>This is the sorcery of scientism—of belief disguised as logic.</p><p>Pharmakeia in its modern form no longer requires potions and cloaks.<br>It wears a lab coat. It speaks in charts.<br>It hides its spellcasting in studies and protocols.</p><p>And the people, stripped of memory, cut off from the sacred, believe.</p><p>They believe that sickness comes from within, not from the system.<br>They believe that authority equals truth.<br>They believe that control is care.</p><p>And in this belief, the spell is sealed.</p><p>Until the moment comes—when the body speaks louder than the broadcast.<br>When the heart remembers what is real.<br>When the soul says: Enough.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h1>The Spiritual Sickness: Inversion as Design</h1><p> </p><h2>The Medicine Wheel Reversed</h2><p>In ancient traditions, medicine was not a product.<br>It was a way of life. A balance. A rhythm.</p><p>The medicine wheel taught that healing came from alignment—between body and spirit, self and earth, time and intention.<br>Sickness was not an enemy. It was a message, a misalignment asking to be made whole again.</p><p>But the wheel has been turned upside down.</p><p>Modern medicine sees the body as a broken machine.<br>It doesn’t listen—it analyzes. It doesn’t balance—it suppresses.<br>Symptoms are not signals. They are problems to be silenced.</p><p>The body is no longer sacred.<br>It is a site of intervention. A revenue stream. A managed asset.</p><p>And so healing, in the old sense, no longer exists in the modern system.</p><p>There is only regulation.<br>There is only management.<br>There is only a prolonged delay of death—profitable, predictable, and insured.</p><p>This is not failure.<br>This is inversion by design.</p><p> </p><h2>The War on Nature</h2><p>The same war wages outward—against the earth, the soil, the seed, the air.</p><p>Clean water is labeled “unsafe.”<br>Raw milk is illegal.<br>Wild herbs are banned.<br>Sunlight is feared.</p><p>Meanwhile, the system pushes tap water laced with chlorine and fluoride, chemical-laden food stamped with approval, and synthetic supplements manufactured in sterile factories.</p><p>Nature is framed as dangerous.<br>Only what is lab-tested is “safe.”<br>Only what is patented is “effective.”</p><p>This inversion is not accidental. It is strategic.<br>Because nature cannot be owned.<br>And what cannot be owned cannot be controlled.</p><p>The war on nature is a war on the sacred.<br>Because nature reminds us of what we are—and what cannot be monetized.</p><p> </p><h2>The Hidden Powers: Pharmakeia and the Sorcery of Commerce</h2><p>In ancient Greek, the word <em>pharmakeia</em> meant more than medicine.</p><p>It meant <strong>sorcery</strong>. Spellcasting. The use of substances to manipulate reality, to veil truth, to control perception.</p><p>This knowledge was once sacred—held in balance, wielded with reverence.<br>But in the hands of empire, it became inversion.</p><p>Pharmakeia became pharmaceutical.<br>The apothecary became the profit center.<br>The healer became the sales rep.</p><p>And so the sorcery was industrialized.</p><p>Now, the spells are written in clinical language.<br>The cauldrons are factories.<br>The potions are pills that disconnect the soul from the body while claiming to cure it.</p><p>We are not being healed.<br>We are being enchanted.</p><p>Not into health—but into forgetfulness.<br>Not into wholeness—but into dependency.<br>Not into life—but into a slow, managed death, paid for in monthly installments.</p><p>This is not health care.<br>This is ritualized inversion.</p><p>And until we see it, we cannot break its spell.</p><p> </p><h1>The Path of Remembrance: Healing as Sacred Rebellion</h1><p> </p><h2>Return to the Healer Within</h2><p>There is a knowing that cannot be programmed.<br>A fire that no chemical can extinguish.</p><p>It lives in your marrow. In your breath. In your dreams.<br>And it whispers, even now: <em>You were never broken.</em></p><p>The body is not a machine. It is a miracle of coherence—an intelligent, responsive, self-healing symphony.<br>But only when we stop poisoning it.<br>Only when we stop interrupting its messages.<br>Only when we start listening.</p><p>True healing is not found in the pharmacy.<br>It is found in presence.<br>In rest.<br>In stillness.<br>In clean water and real food.<br>In movement and sunlight.<br>In tears that are allowed to fall.<br>In relationships that are honest.<br>In sleep that is deep.<br>In breath that is conscious.</p><p>These are not “alternatives.”<br>They are the foundation.<br>Everything else is noise.</p><p> </p><h2>Awakening the Sacred Witness</h2><p>The system depends on your forgetfulness.<br>It thrives on your obedience.<br>It survives by replacing your knowing with its “knowledge.”</p><p>But you can wake up.</p><p>Begin by noticing.<br>How does your body feel after their food?<br>After their pills?<br>After their news?</p><p>And how does it feel after spring water?<br>After silence?<br>After truth?</p><p>This is the return of discernment—the sacred witness within you that cannot be bought, cannot be gaslit, cannot be broken.</p><p>When you awaken the witness, you begin to see clearly:<br>The system was never about health.<br>It was about harvesting.</p><p>And you no longer consent.</p><p>You no longer comply.</p><p>You remember.</p><p> </p><h2>Building the Garden of the Next World</h2><p>We will not fix this system.<br>It is not broken—it is built this way.</p><p>The solution is not reform.<br>It is <em>rebirth</em>.</p><p>And so we plant.</p><p>We build not new institutions, but new <em>soils</em>.<br>We weave healing into kitchens, into gardens, into whispered stories, into shared songs.</p><p>We seed networks of remembrance—where midwives, herbalists, elders, movement guides, water stewards, and barefoot physicians gather not around billing codes, but around sacred intent.</p><p>The future of healing is mycelial.<br>Decentralized. Rooted. Alive.</p><p>A remembering that spreads underground until the old system collapses under the weight of its own forgetting.</p><p>This is not rebellion for rebellion’s sake.<br>This is rebellion as reverence.</p><p>It is choosing coherence over convenience.<br>It is choosing sovereignty over sedation.<br>It is choosing life—whole, holy, and untamed.</p><p> </p><h1>Epilogue: For Those Who Carry the Flame</h1><p>You are not crazy.<br>You are not alone.<br>You are not broken.</p><p>You live in a world that was inverted before you arrived.<br>A world that poisons and then profits.<br>That silences and then shames.<br>That calls suppression safety and calls healing rebellion.</p><p>But you are waking up.</p><p>And that makes you dangerous—not because you are violent, but because you can see.</p><p>You see the machinery behind the mask.<br>You see the lies dressed as care.<br>You see the empire of pharmaceuticals for what it is: a cathedral of control, built on fear, fed by suffering.</p><p>And still—you choose light.</p><p>You choose to remember the body’s wisdom.<br>You choose to trust the knowing that rises before the research.<br>You choose to live in alignment with what is sacred, not what is sanctioned.</p><p>This is not a small act.<br>This is revolution at the level of soul.</p><p>So plant your garden.<br>Make your medicine.<br>Tell your story.<br>Refuse their spell.<br>And when the next fear campaign begins—stand still in the storm.</p><p>You are a keeper of the flame.<br>A carrier of coherence.<br>A guardian of the sacred path.</p><p>Let their system collapse.</p><p>Let your presence be the healing it tried to replace.<br>Let your memory be the truth it tried to erase.</p><p>And when others awaken, as they will,<br>Let them find your light.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 26, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://	luc-and-the-machine.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://	luc-and-the-machine.github.io/blog/authors/luc-and-the-machine/" rel="author">Luc and the Machine</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://	luc-and-the-machine.github.io/blog/the-codex-of-natures-capture-ritual-design-for-resistance-in-an-era-of-synthetic-ecology.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Nature’s Capture - Resistance in an Era of Synthetic Ecology</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii, GitHub, and Cloudflare.</p><p><a href="http://www.freevisitorcounters.com">at freevisitorcounters.com</a><script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.freevisitorcounters.com/auth.php?id=220385d6a9c7bfeef6701f81a58d6d7f28dcc64c"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.freevisitorcounters.com/en/home/counter/1320301/t/5"></script></p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://	luc-and-the-machine.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://	luc-and-the-machine.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
