But that's exactly what Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is all about. It's a technique that's gaining buzz as a way to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere and lock it away. Companies are even selling "carbon credits" based on it, allowing polluters to offset their emissions. But is it as straightforward as it sounds? Let's break it down in simple terms, drawing from expert discussions and research. I'll explain the basics, the science, the real-world challenges, and why those carbon credits might not be as rock-solid as advertised.</p><h2>What Is ERW, Anyway?I</h2><p>Imagine taking rocks like basalt or olivine (the kind you might find in volcanoes), grinding them into fine dust, and spreading them over farmland, grasslands, or even beaches. That's ERW in a nutshell. It's inspired by nature's own slow process of rock weathering, where rocks naturally react with CO2 in rainwater over thousands of years, pulling about 1.1 billion tons of CO2 from the air annually. ERW speeds this up by making the rocks finer, increasing their surface area for faster reactions.The goal? Sequester (trap) atmospheric CO2 to combat climate change. Proponents say it could remove 0.5–2 billion tons of CO2 per year by 2050 if scaled up on croplands in places like the US, Brazil, China, and India. Plus, it has side perks: the dust can improve soil health, boost crop yields (up to 16% in some trials), and even help oceans fight acidification. Sounds great, right? But as we'll see, the devil's in the details—especially when it comes to proving it actually works long-term.</p><h2>The Basic Chemistry: How Rocks "Eat" CO2</h2><p>Let's keep this simple—no PhD required. Atmospheric CO2 mixes with rainwater to form a weak acid called carbonic acid (H₂CO₃). This acid reacts with minerals in the rock dust, like calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg) silicates. Here's a basic reaction for calcium silicate:</p><p>CaSiO₃ (rock mineral) + 2CO₂ + H₂O → Ca²⁺ + 2HCO₃⁻ (bicarbonate) + SiO₂ (silica)</p><p>In plain English: The rock breaks down, releasing calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻). This process grabs two CO2 molecules but often releases one back later, netting one CO2 removed per reaction.</p><p>What happens next to those bicarbonates is key:</p><ul><li>Stay in the soil: They might form stable carbonates like limestone (CaCO₃), improving soil structure. But this isn't always permanent—acids from fertilizers or rain can dissolve them, releasing CO2 back.</li><li>Leach into water: Rain washes them into streams, rivers, and eventually oceans. Here, they boost ocean alkalinity (making it less acidic) and can form long-lasting marine carbonates (think coral reefs or sediments).</li></ul><p> </p><p>The ocean path is the gold standard for "permanent" removal—lasting 10,000 to 100,000+ years. Soil storage? More like centuries, and it's vulnerable to farming practices like tilling or plant uptake (where carbon cycles back into the air via respiration or decay).</p><h2>Factors That Impact Actual Long-Term CO2 Removal</h2><p>Not all ERW projects are created equal. Several factors determine if that CO2 stays locked away for good:</p><ul><li>Rock Type and Size: Basalt or olivine work best because they're rich in Ca and Mg. Finer particles (under 10 microns) dissolve faster (months to years), but grinding them takes energy (and emits CO2 if not done renewably). Coarser grains? Decades or centuries.</li><li>Climate and Soil: Warm, wet, acidic soils speed things up—think tropics like Brazil. Cold, dry, or alkaline soils slow it down. In humid areas, 70-90% of bicarbonates leach out; in dry spots, more stay in soil (riskier for permanence).</li><li>Farming Practices: Fertilizers can dissolve rocks without capturing CO2 (using non-carbonic acids). Tilling disturbs soil, potentially releasing stored carbon. Crop boosts are real (e.g., 12-16% higher yields in US corn trials), but they might recycle some carbon back into plants and air.</li><li>Pathway to Ocean: Leaching is crucial for true longevity. But en route, 10-50% of CO2 might "degas" from rivers (escape back to air). Cations can also "stick" in soil (up to 98% retained), delaying or preventing bicarbonate export.</li><li>Permanence Risks: Soil carbonates last ~10,000 years in ideal conditions but can reverse in decades under acidification. Ocean bicarbonates? ~90% stay stored for centuries to millennia, with some becoming sediments lasting millions of years. Models show ~9% leakage for silicates, but field trials often underperform lab predictions by 2-4 orders of magnitude.</li></ul><p> </p><p>In short, ERW isn't a quick fix. Dissolution might happen in months, export in seasons to years, and atmospheric "drawdown" (CO2 actually leaving the air) in months after reaching the ocean. But lags, losses, and reversals mean not all dissolved rock equals permanent removal.</p><h2>The Measurement Challenge: Labs vs. Models vs. Reality</h2><p>Here's where it gets tricky. To sell carbon credits, companies need to prove how much CO2 is removed—and for how long. But ERW is an "open system," so tracking every molecule is impossible.</p><ul><li>Lab Techniques: Scientists use soil sampling to measure cation depletion (e.g., Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺ loss via mass balance against "immobile" tracers like titanium). Water tests check alkalinity, bicarbonate export, and isotopes (like δ¹³C or Δ¹⁴C) to trace sources. Precision is good—labs detect changes as small as ±2-3 µmol/kg for alkalinity or ±1‰ for isotopes. But field variability (soil patches, rain patterns) dwarfs this: you need 30-100+ samples per field for stats, costing $15,000-50,000.</li><li>The Model Gap: Labs measure dissolution ("Rock dust dissolved this much here"), but they can't directly track long-term fate. Models fill in: They estimate bicarbonate export, river losses, ocean storage, and timelines (e.g., 20-30 years for 80% dissolution of 10-micron olivine). Tools like SMEW or FAO-56 simulate hydrology and kinetics. Registries (e.g., Isometric, Puro.earth) allow this, with assumptions like 50% efficiency losses or literature-based retention factors.</li><li>No Leaching? No Guarantee: If bicarbonates don't leach (common in dry or sticky soils), they're stuck in soil—vulnerable to re-release or plant cycling. Models assume export happens eventually, but field trials show lags: One Australian sugarcane study detected zero net removal in Year 1 due to cation retention. Another in Malaysia had weak signals. Only ~32 true field trials exist (vs. 174+ lab studies), and many show "zero or net emissions" in early years.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Carbon registries simplify: They credit based on "protocols" with two paths (e.g., Isometric's Determination 1: soil-focused; Determination 2: water-focused). But many use models to "complete" the picture, assuming hypothetical long-term removals. This isn't direct proof—it's inferred.</p><h2>Carbon Credits: Promises of Removal, But Weak on Proof</h2><p>Companies like UNDO, Lithos, and InPlanet are deploying ERW and selling credits (first issued in 2025 for 235 tons in Brazil). Buyers pay $100-500+ per ton to offset emissions, assuming "durable" removal. But here's the rub: These credits often rely on weak evidence.</p><p>In plain terms:</p><ul><li>What’s measured: “Rock dust dissolved this much here.”</li><li>What’s modeled/assumed: “That dissolution translates into X bicarbonate export and Y long-lived ocean storage, on Z timeline.”</li></ul><p> </p><p>Calling those Year-1 tonnes “removals” at high prices is a methodology choice, not a direct observation of CO₂ leaving the air. Even sympathetic analysts caution buyers to prefer water-anchored MRV (Isometric’s Determination 2) if they want credibly measured export, not just dissolution.</p><p>Bottom line on value: these are measurement-anchored, model-completed tonnes. They are not the same as “we measured X tonnes of bicarbonate flowing off the land into the ocean this year.” If a buyer pays $10 or 100+ for them, they’re paying for an early-stage claim with real measurement and timing risk that should be discounted or staged until export is actually detected and attributed.</p><p>If you want a single-sentence description: “In this ERW project, carbon credits were allocated for measured rock dissolution in Year 1, with the removal part inferred by models and protocol parameters rather than directly measured as exported bicarbonate to the ocean.”</p><p>Critics call this greenwashing potential: Over-crediting if models overestimate, or under-verified if no leaching occurs. Field data shows rates as low as 0.026 tCO2/ha/year vs. modeled 1-4 tons. For true credibility, we need more direct export measurements, insurance against reversals, and staged payments.</p><h2>Wrapping Up: Proceed with Caution</h2><p>ERW has real potential as a low-tech CDR tool with farm benefits. But for carbon credits to mean something, we need better proof—not just dissolved rocks and models. If you're a buyer or investor, demand water-based MRV and transparency. Until then, these credits are more "hopeful offset" than proven removal. Climate action needs honesty, not hype. What do you think—worth the risk?
