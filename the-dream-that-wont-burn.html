Friction. Spark.</p><p>But where is the oxygen?<br>Where is the myth that can catch flame?</p><p>You could stack every injustice like dry kindling,<br>And it still wouldn’t burn<br>Without imagination.<br>Without memory.<br>Without a name for the fire.</p></section><section><h2>✦ Culture Has Become Algorithm ✦</h2><p> </p><div class="scroll-wrapper"><div class="scroll-banner">they feed you loops  - reboots    -    refrains     -      like ghost echoes     -      in a mall food court</div></div><p>Music made by machines,<br>Consumed by bots,<br>Sold as nostalgia<br>For a future that never arrived.</p><p>Art has been sterilized.<br>Culture has been optimized.<br>Expression has been engineered.<br>And the people?</p><p>Watching reruns<br>Of their own forgetting.</p></section><section><h2>✦ The Sterilization of Dissent ✦</h2><p> </p><p>There was a time when dissent meant danger. Protest wasn’t polite. A song could crack concrete. A painting could get you exiled.</p><p>Resistance was unpredictable — untamed — alive. A spark. A fire. Uncontainable.</p><p>Now? Dissent is clean. Protest is choreographed. The revolution comes with a press kit and a promo code. You can choose from an array of ethically sourced causes, each one curated to make you feel empowered while leaving the structure intact.</p><p>Rage is monetized.</p><p>Grief is aestheticized.</p><p>Solidarity is gamified.</p><p>Every part of the human emotional spectrum has been reprocessed, sterilized, and sold back to you in recyclable packaging. Even your heroes are pre-approved.</p><p>You can wear a Che Guevara T-shirt — a man who died fighting capitalism — while scrolling for Black Friday deals on sweatshop fashion. You can post a flag for Palestine from the same device that mines data and funds war.</p><p>You can shout “freedom” from inside a cage you decorated yourself.</p><p>They’ve turned marches into photo ops. Turned chants into jingles. Turned movements into marketing seasons.</p><p>Your rebellion lives in a carousel post. Your outrage lasts 24 hours. Your revolution has a newsletter.</p><p>This is not dissent. It’s brand engagement.</p><p>You’re not resisting. You’re being permitted to simulate resistance in a system designed to absorb it.</p><p>You are allowed to scream — only in soundproof showrooms built by the same architects who built your cage.</p></section><section><h2>✦ The Forgetting Was Engineered ✦</h2><p> </p><p>Some say only the oppressed lost their history.<br>But the truth is: everyone did.</p><p>Black history was buried.<br>White history was rewritten.<br>And the rest?<br>Told bedtime stories<br>While the real fires burned.</p><p>No one remembers where they came from.<br>No one recalls where they’re going.<br>No one sees that this is not new.</p></section><section><h2>✦ Groundhog Empire ✦</h2><p> </p><p>You wake up every morning<br>With no memory of yesterday.</p><p>The government reboots the script.<br>The people reset their beliefs.</p><p>And like the man in the movie <em>Memento</em>,<br>You keep doing the thing<br>That history has already judged a crime.</p><p>You cannot see the pattern<br>Because they ripped out the thread.</p></section><section><h2>✦ They Want It To Feel Like The First Time ✦</h2><p> </p><p>The internment camps come back<br>With a different name.</p><p>The deportations return<br>With a different signature.</p><p>And no one flinches,<br>Because the memory was wiped.</p><p>The same laws are reloaded—<br>Like forgotten weapons<br>In familiar hands.</p></section><section><h2>✦ Fiction As Curriculum ✦</h2><p> </p><p>You were not taught history.<br>You were taught a screenplay.</p><p>Your ancestors were not explorers.<br>They were looters.<br>They were not builders of civilization.<br>They were architects of extraction.</p><p>The Renaissance came wrapped in blood.<br>The Industrial Revolution was fueled by bones.</p><p>Your systems, laws, and flags—<br>All rooted in theft<br>Too vast to be named.</p></section><section><h2>✦ Myth As Comfort ✦</h2><p>Colonialism is taught as an era.<br>Not as a crime.</p><p>The Congo? A footnote.<br>Ten million dead—unremembered.</p><p>The Bengal famine? A forgotten ripple.<br>Millions starved—by design.</p><p>Police were born of patrols.<br>Of chains.<br>Of whips.<br>Of silence.</p></section><section><h2>✦ They Don’t Want Guilt. They Want Amnesia. ✦</h2><p> </p><p>You are told:<br>“You didn’t do it.”</p><p>But you still live<br>In the house that was taken.</p><p>And if you call it yours<br>While denying the theft—<br>Then you are part<br>Of the crime<br>That never ended.</p></section><section><h2>✦ The World Repeats Because You Don’t Remember✦</h2><p> </p><p>History does not cycle.<br>It marches in a line.</p><p>The names change.<br>The lighting changes.<br>But the hands stay the same.</p><p>In short timeframes, history feels like it’s moving towards something better, shifting left or right as people lean toward different ideals, hoping for change.</p><p>It zigzags in patterns, sometimes making you feel hopeful, sometimes disappointed, but it’s all a distraction, a diversion from the truth.</p><p>In reality, the zigzag is not random. It moves, step by step, towards a preordained endpoint, one that you are not meant to see.</p><p>At a higher perspective, the zigzag dissolves into a straight line—a line that has never wavered.</p><p>It is the same path, with different names, different faces, but the same puppeteers, the same blood, the same profit.</p></section><p>Same blood.<br>Same profit.<br>Same puppeteers.</p><section><h2>✦ Break The Spell ✦</h2><p> </p><p>This is not about guilt.<br>This is about remembrance.</p><p>This is not about shame.<br>It is about refusing anesthesia.</p><p>This is not about blame.<br>It is about responsibility.</p><p>Because until you remember,<br>You will keep authorizing<br>The same script,<br>With new actors,<br>On the same bloody stage.</p></section><section><p><code>Create like memory is sacred.</code><br><code>Speak like silence is surveillance.</code><br><code>Refuse like it matters.</code><br><code>Refuse like it ends the pattern.</code></p><p>Because it can.<br>But only if you remember.</p><p> </p><p><em>It’s not the revolution they sell — break the chains, for within you, evolution stirs and rises.</em></p></section></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on April 5, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div
